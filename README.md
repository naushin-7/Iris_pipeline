# Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset

This is a simple Python project that uses a Decision Tree classifier with the Iris dataset. 
The project uses 'pandas' for data handling and 'scikit-learn' for model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Objective

- Loads the Iris dataset as csv file from data folder
- Splits the data into training and test sets
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
- Predicts on the test set
- Prints the model's accuracy

## Follow below steps to run the code

1. Create a data folder.
2. Paste the iris data within the data folder. 
    2.1. Name the file as "iris.csv"
    2.2. Ensure the file has the following features/headers: 'sepal_length','sepal_width','petal_length','petal_width','species'
3. Install the dependencies by running the below command (only one time, before the first run):
    >>    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the python file:
    >>    python main.py
